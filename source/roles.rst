Roles
=====

We're all *volunteers*.

Within that, there are some distinctions.

*Leads* "own" an area - they're responsible for decision-making within that, and have relatively broad areas of responsibility - like ensuring that our attendees get fed, or arranging the programme etc.

*Crew* take on specified roles and tasks - smaller and narrower in scope than lead roles, but no less vitally important - getting a speaker to the right room, chairing a talk session, or crewing the front desk etc.

Taking a lead role is a larger commitment
